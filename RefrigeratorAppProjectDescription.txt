App Name: Fridge It (tentative)


Description:
The purpose of the app will be to keep a list of the current
contents of a refrigerator.  The app will act like a repository 
that can be accessed by multiple people (ideally those who are 
using the actual refrigerator).  The repository will contain two 
lists.  The first list keeps track of the current contents of a 
refrigerator.  Each entry on this list will track the name, 
expiration, and owner of the item the entry is for.  Other 
information to be tracked may be added in the future.  There will 
be an option to add and remove entries to the list that can be done 
by all the users who have access to the list.  The second list will 
be a “shopping list” to indicate items that the users wish to acquire, 
though the item does not necessarily have to be for the refrigerator.  
The shopping list will be similar to the refrigerator list in that each 
entry will contain an information about an item’s name and possibly other 
stuff.  The lists will be synced between users in real time assuming 
that all users are online.  If a user is offline, they will have a copy 
the most updated repository they were able to obtain but will not be 
able to edit the repository.  There will be no notifications when the 
repositories will be changed (possibly add an option to allow some 
notifications in the future).  The interface should look nice 
(i.e. picture of a fridge as the main background) and implement drag 
and drop features. There will be a search function to search each 
lists for specific items and a sort function to sort each list using 
categories such as expiration date or owner.
